A small wedding application in the Ethereum ropsten blockchain   

This project was done under a course at Universit√© Claude Bernard Lyon 1.  

Using Solidity 0.5.0 framework, it is a wedding-certificate-into-the-blockchain application.  

A .html with javascript is using the API provided by the wedding application in the blockchain to handle creation of "Wedding certificates".
